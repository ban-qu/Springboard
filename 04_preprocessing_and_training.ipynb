    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

As expected, this produced an $R^2$ of zero for both the training and test set, because $R^2$ tells us how much of the variance you're explaining beyond that of using just the mean, and you were using just the mean. Here we see that our simple linear regression model explains over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. Clearly you are onto something, although the much lower value for the test set suggests you're overfitting somewhat.

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "In pre-possessing and data training step, the data is split into training and test for machine learning models. The ratio of split is 70/30. Training data involves all factors other than `AdultWeekend` and test data only includes `AdultWeekend`. `Name`, `state`, and `Region` are removed and only numeric factors are reserved for X_train and X_test.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual mean (i.e.,  average price, y_train) is examined first as a predictor and is compared with means from `DummyRegressor` method. The result suggests that two values closely match with each other. Metrics (R-squared, MSE, and MAE) are used to examine the quality of ‘guess’ on ticket pricing based on average. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is applied first on the model prediction. Both manual and pipeline methods are practiced in the following manners: imputing missing values (median and mean, respectively), scaling the features, training the linear regression model, and calculating model performance. The results are the same for both manual and pipeline methods. The performance metrics for imputing missing values with Median and Mean are as follows: <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the model always performs worse in the test data, it is suspected that the model is overfitting. To select the best features to fit the model, we refine the linear model with `SelectKBest` function along with cross-validation and `GridSearchCV`. Basically, we build k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data without touching the test set. As a result, k=8 (i.e., 8 features) gives the best performance. According to the model, `vertical_drop` is greatly associated with pricing, followed by `Snow Making_ac`, `total_chairs`, `fastQuads`, and `Runs`, etc. It is similar to the results we did on EDA previously. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, random forest model is performed for the regression analysis. We fit and assess performance using pipeline and cross-validation again. The model suggests that the dominant top four features correspond with the linear model: `fastQuads`, `Runs`, `Snow Making_ac`, and `vertical_drop`. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, MAE is used along with `cross_validate`to select the best model between linear regression and random forest. As a result, random forest model has a lower cross-validation mean absolute error which suggests it is a better model in this case (9.6231 for random forest vs. 11.7934 for linear regression). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, data quantity assessment is performed to see if more data collection is needed for better prediction. The `learning_curve` suggests that data sample is sufficient around 40-50, which means we have plenty of data and no further data collection required. "
